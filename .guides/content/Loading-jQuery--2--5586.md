### Option 2 : from jQuery CDN

To use it from the CDN, you can go here : https://jquery.com/download/#using-jquery-with-a-cdn

But basically you don't need to download anything and you can just add it directly to your page.

For example, just add this to your page: 

```
<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
```

In the examples that follow, you can consider that jQuery is already referenced from the page and available.
