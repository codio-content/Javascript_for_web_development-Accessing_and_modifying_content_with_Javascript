# Recap
In the previous units we have seen how to use HTML and CSS to create *static* web pages and style them as we wish. Those page are "frozen" and the only user interaction is through user clicking on links and visiting other static pages.

# In this unit
In this unit, we will see how to make our page more dynamic and interactive by using Javascript (JS). We will see how to use JS to add/remove/change HTML elements and CSS properties of our page when we want and when the user interacts with it.
