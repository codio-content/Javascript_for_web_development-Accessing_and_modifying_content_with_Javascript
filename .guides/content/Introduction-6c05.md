# Recap
In the previous unit we have seen an introduction to javascript for the browser, we have seen how to load our own scripts, how to use a timer and how to wait for the browser to be fully loaded before executing our own scripts.

# In this unit
In this unit, we will see how to use JS to add/remove/change HTML elements and CSS properties of our page when we want or when the user interacts with it.
