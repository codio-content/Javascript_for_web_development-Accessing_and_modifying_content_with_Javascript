Sometimes we want to access something that doesn't have an ID or we want to access multiple elements or we don't know the ID of the element beforehand because it was generated by code or it might change.

For that we have another way of getting elements out of the DOM. It's by using the syntax of the CSS selectors, it's a very powerful syntax that allows us to target about anything in the DOM.

To use it we call the function `document.querySelector`, like this:

```
document.querySelector("ul > li")
```

This would return the first element that match this CSS selector.

There is a variant of the function that will return all the elements that match the CSS selector and it's called:  `document.querySelectorAll`
