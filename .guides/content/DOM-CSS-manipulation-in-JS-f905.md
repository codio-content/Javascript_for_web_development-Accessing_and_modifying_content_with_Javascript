In this chapter we will see different techniques to manipulate the DOM.

For all the examples that follow, we will use a common basic HTML page which you can find in the top left hand pane along with its preview underneath.

This page has a `div` with ID `container` and all the examples below will work by altering this `div`.

When you will see a blue button saying "RUN THIS CODE", you can click on it and it will run immediately the code displayed above it in the bottom left hand pane preview.
